Cloud computing is an on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with primarily pay-as-you-go pricing. AWS maintain infrustures, virtual data center and services.

## Six advantages of cloud computing

### Pay as you go

Instead of investing in data centers and hardwares, you only pay for the computing resources you use. 

### Benefit from massive economies of scale

As thousands of customers are aggregated in the cloud, lower pay as-you-go price.

### Stop guessing capacity

You can scale up and down as you want with a few minutes.

### Increase speed and agility

Resources are available to developers from weeks to minutes. Since cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

### Realize cost savings

Cloud computing lets you focus on customers rather than on heavy lifting. 

### Go global in minutes

Applications can be deployed in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks. This means that you cn provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.

Recommendation : Use at least 2 AZs, if one AZ fails, the application will have infrasture up and running in a second AZ to take over the traffic.

## Interacting with AWS
